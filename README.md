The mcib3d library is the core for most of the mcib3d plugins developed. This is a joint effort to create robust library for 3D images and objects for analysis. Main developers are Thomas Boudier and Jean Ollion.

Please follow these instructions to download and compile the source code : 

`git clone https://framagit.org/mcib3d/mcib3d-plugins.git`

`mvn clean process-resources`

You then should be able to open the project in Netbeans or Eclipse.
